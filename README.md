# üçïPizza Sales Analysis Project - Python
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>In this project, I utilized tools such as Jupyter Notebook, along with pandas and matplotlib libraries, to perform a comprehensive analysis of pizza store sales data. My primary focus was to identify key trends and patterns, evaluate the performance of various pizza types as well as the overall store, and uncover actionable insights. I also provided data-driven recommendations aimed at improving store performance and enhancing operational efficiency.</p>
<h2>Data source:</h2>
<p>For this project, I utilized four CSV files downloaded from Kaggle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pizzas: Contains size and price information for all pizza types</li>
  <li>Pizza_types: Provides detailed descriptions of each pizza type, including its category and ingredients.</li>
  <li>Orders: Includes the date and time for every order placed.</li>
  <li>Order_details: Offers detailed information about each order, such as the specific pizzas purchased and their quantities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools and Skills used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Cleaning and Transformation:</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the data was already clean, so I didn't have the opportunity to practice data cleaning tasks like handling null or duplicate values. However, I performed several data transformation operations, such as adding new columns and merging various tables to create a more insightful dataset for analysis.</p>
<h2>Key Metrics Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Total Revenue:</b> Used to evaluate and compare the performance of different pizza categories. This metric provided insights into overall pizza sales on a monthly and quarterly basis.</li>
  <li><b>Total Orders:</b> Since price differences among pizza types could skew revenue comparisons, this metric helped provide a clearer picture of performance by focusing on order volumes rather than revenue alone.</li>
  <li><b>Revenue per Pizza Variety:</b> Provided a more granular understanding of the performance across pizza categories, making comparisons between pizza types more accurate.</li>
  <li><b>Revenue per Order:</b> This metric offered valuable insights into both pricing and performance across pizza types. Also, it gave a better understanding of customer preferences and pricing strategies.</li>
  <p>In addition to these metrics, I also utilized other parameters such as weekday sales comparisons, top 10 pizzas by revenue and orders, the average price of pizzas, etc. All these metrics collectively helped to create a more comprehensive view and understanding of the sales data.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Key Insights:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Total Revenue has been steadily declining since Q2.</li>
  <li>Both Total Revenue and Orders saw significant drops in August and September.</li>
  <li>The 'Veggie' category experienced a sharp decline in both orders and revenue.</li>
  <li>'Classic' pizzas hold the highest total revenue and order volume across all categories.</li>
  <li>For 'S' and 'M' size pizzas, 'Classic' has the highest demand.</li>
  <li>In 'L' size pizzas, 'Veggie' dominates in terms of demand.</li>
  <li>The average price for 'Classic' pizzas is noticeably lower than other categories, resulting in the lowest Revenue per Order for this category.</li>
  <li>'Chicken' pizzas lead in Revenue per Variety, as they have the fewest varieties but the highest average price, giving them a competitive edge.</li>
  <li>Among the top 10 pizzas by revenue, 4 are from the 'Chicken' category, and 3 are from 'Supreme'.</li>
  <li>Among the top 10 pizzas by orders, 4 belong to 'Chicken', and 3 to 'Classic'.</li>
  <li>Friday has the highest sales, followed by Thursday and Saturday, which are also key sales days.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For the 'Veggie' category, underperforming varieties should be eliminated. Offering too many options can dilute the customer experience, while fewer, well-performing varieties can reduce costs and increase profit margins.</li>
  <li>Given the strong demand for 'L' size Veggie pizzas, the savings from eliminating underperforming varieties should be reinvested into enhancing the quality and marketing of the 'L' size Veggie pizzas. Offering targeted discounts could also boost sales.</li>
  <li>The price of 'Classic' pizzas, particularly for the 'S' size, should be raised to better align with market demand.</li>
  <li>Reducing some 'Classic' varieties, especially for 'L' size pizzas (where demand is lower), would be advantageous.</li>
  <li>The owner should prioritize Classic and Chicken pizzas in marketing efforts, particularly those that rank in the top 10 for sales and revenue.</li>
  <li>To capitalize on the popularity of Chicken pizzas, introducing a new variety in the XL or XXL size could attract more customers.</li>
  <li>Offering discounts or promotions on Chicken and Supreme pizzas on Thursday and Friday (high sales days) could boost demand, especially since these pizzas have higher prices.</li>
  <li>Streamlining the number of varieties across all categories is recommended, with Veggie pizzas being the top priority for elimination.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
<p>This project provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen my technical skills in Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. It allowed me to explore various business aspects, familiarize myself with relevant metrics, and, most importantly, seek solutions to real business challenges. As I‚Äôve often read in LinkedIn posts, every dataset holds a hidden story. Through this project, I tried to bring out that story, drawing on my growing knowledge and analytical capabilities.</p>
